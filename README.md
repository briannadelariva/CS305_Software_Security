# CS305_Software_Security

#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client was Artemis Financial, a financial institution responsible for handling checking, savings, investment, and retirement accounts for various clients. They were seeking guidance on how additional security measures could be taken within their existing code to help better protect their customers' data.

#What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I believe something I did well was the certificate generation and the check sum. I enjoyed working within the terminal and checking the security of the application first hand. Certificates and checksum verifications are vital to maintaining a secure code because it helps recognize authorization by the user and enhance protection. Software security plays a crucial role in safe internet usage and protecting sensitive information against hackers. By protecting the clients data, we are protecting the overall company's wellbeing and its core values. 


#What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I believe a helpful part of the vulnerability assessment included the dependency check tool for expediting the amount of time it would take to review the vulnerabilities.

#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I was able to increase the layers of security by analyzing the code and creating revisements to it. This would include making changes to ensure the most up-to-date of libraries were being used. By focusing on testing and analyzing the code for up-to-date information, it will enhance the security and thus make it more secure code. 

#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I was able to check that the code was functional and secure by debugging and running to test it before and after refractoring. I also checked the vulnerability report to note any changes as well.

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I utilized the debugging tool, as well as the Postman application to check my changes to the code and request changes. Additionally, comments were utilized to ensure best practices.

#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The utilization of a hash function to enhance security and create secure transmission of communications for Artemis Financial's transactions.
